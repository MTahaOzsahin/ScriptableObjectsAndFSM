-------------------------------Need Fix -----------------------------------




-------------------------------Completed-----------------------------------
Fixed: Patrol state does not work if there is more than one enemy in scene. Because in PatrolAction script i did use global variable so all patrol enemies in scene try to use only one variable i created. Now i changed to local variable so every enemy use their one.

Fixed: while searching, if player get back in fow now enemy react.

Fixed: After search enemy go to initial state.
